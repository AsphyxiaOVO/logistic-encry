The logistic map is a common nonlinear mapping equation, and its expression is as follows:
            𝑋𝑛+1=𝑟×𝑋𝑛×(1−𝑋𝑛)×Xn+1
where 𝑋𝑛 is the system state at step n,  Xn+1 is the system state at the next step, and r is a parameter controlling the behavior of the system, typically taking values in the range [0, 4]. The values generated by the logistic map fall within the range [0, 1]. When r exceeds the critical value of 3.57, the system enters a chaotic state. In the chaotic state, small changes in the initial conditions can lead to entirely different system trajectories.

In the chaotic state, the logistic map can generate a set of encryption keys with good pseudorandomness. The generated chaotic sequence can be used to perform one or more rounds of XOR operations with the pixels of the original image. After the XOR operation, the pixel values of the image are altered, and the original information is hidden. During decryption, using 𝑟0, 𝑥0, and the number of encryption rounds, the decryption key can be generated, and the corresponding number of XOR operations can be applied to the encrypted image to retrieve the decrypted image.


PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) are two commonly used metrics for measuring the similarity between two images. PSNR is based on the brightness, contrast, and noise of the image, while SSIM is based on the brightness, contrast, and structure of the image. From the encryption results, it can be observed that when r is greater than 3.57, a chaotic sequence is generated and used as a stream key for image encryption. The PSNR value of the encrypted image is much lower than 20 dB, and the SSIM value fluctuates around 0, indicating that the encrypted image has significant differences from the original image with almost no correlation.

When changing the number of encryption rounds, the initial value 𝑋0, and the parameter r, the PSNR and SSIM values do not change significantly. This indicates that altering the initial conditions does not result in a noticeable difference in the encryption effect, and the images all exhibit good confidentiality. This greatly increases the difficulty of an attacker's decryption attempts.
